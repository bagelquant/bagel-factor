# Proposal: Universal Factor Performance Evaluation Package for Equity Trading

## Overview

This package aims to provide a universal, high-performance toolkit for evaluating the performance of quantitative factors in equity trading. It is designed to be flexible, extensible, and efficient, leveraging the power of `pandas` and `numpy` for fast computation and easy integration with existing data pipelines.

## Key Objectives

- **Universality**: Support a wide range of factor types (price-based, fundamental, alternative data, etc.) and data frequencies (daily, intraday).
- **Performance**: Optimize for speed and memory efficiency using vectorized operations in `numpy`/`pandas`.
- **Extensibility**: Modular design to allow users to add custom metrics, filters, and workflows.
- **Usability**: Simple, well-documented API with clear input/output formats.

### Core Features

1. **Factor Data Handling**
    - Standardized input format for factor values, returns, and metadata.
    - Support for multi-indexed DataFrames (e.g., [date, asset]).
    - Built-in data validation and cleaning utilities.

2. **Performance Metrics**
    - Information Coefficient (IC/Rank IC)
    - Quantile/Group Return Analysis
    - Turnover and Coverage
    - Sharpe/Sortino Ratios
    - Drawdown and Risk Metrics
    - Custom metric registration

3. **Visualization**
    - Built-in plotting for IC time series, quantile returns, turnover, etc.
    - Export to common formats (CSV, Excel, images)

4. **Parallelization (Optional)**
    - Optional support for multi-core computation (via `numba`, `joblib`, or similar)

## Interface Design

User interactions with the package will be through at least two main classes:

- **Evaluator**: handles the adding data, computing metrics, and running backtests.
- **Visualizer**: manages plotting and exporting results.

### Implementation Plan

1. Define the structure of the project
2. Define data structures and input validation logic
3. Implement core metric calculations (IC, quantile returns, etc.)
4. Add visualization utilities
5. Write documentation and usage examples
6. Optimize for performance and add optional parallelization
7. Package for PyPI and provide installation instructions

### Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
- statsmodels (for statistical tests)
- matplotlib/seaborn (for visualization)
- (Optional) numba/joblib for parallelization

### Deliverables

- Well-tested, documented Python package
- Example notebooks and API documentation
- CI/CD setup for testing and deployment
