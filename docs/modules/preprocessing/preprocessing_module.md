# Preprocessing Module

Data preprocessing is a foundational step in quantitative finance, ensuring that raw financial data is transformed into a clean, consistent, and analysis-ready format. Effective preprocessing improves model performance, reduces bias, and helps extract meaningful insights from complex datasets.

This module provides a suite of tools for:

- **[Standardization](standardize_module.md):** Scaling features to comparable ranges or distributions, which is essential for many statistical and machine learning models.
- **[Outlier Handling](outlier_module.md):** Detecting and managing anomalous data points to enhance the robustness and reliability of analyses.
- **[Missing Data Imputation](missing_module.md):** Systematically filling in missing values to maintain data integrity and prevent information loss.

Each submodule is designed to address a specific aspect of preprocessing, allowing users to build flexible and robust data pipelines tailored to financial applications.
